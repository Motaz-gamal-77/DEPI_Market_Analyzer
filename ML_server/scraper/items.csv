0,26,Lipton Yellow Label Tea International Blend 31.74oz,5.0,"I love using this tea in my Keurig, but I love strong tea. I even got my son and daughter in law loving this tea. We make a cup of tea with milk and sugar, I've never liked coffee, so this is my go to wake up drink every morning. Great flavor"
0,26,Lipton Yellow Label Tea International Blend 31.74oz,4.0,I've always made tea using loose leaves but the product was becoming scarce on groceries shelves.  Then found this. Its great. So glad to have this product back.
2,26,Lipton Yellow Label Tea International Blend 31.74oz,1.0,"When I opened the box the tea is not loose leaf. It's looks like processed crumbles. Used for a week and the taste is poor. Will be throwing away, which sucks for what I spent on this. I had purchased loose leaf in the store before (just cannot find anymore), when comparing the two products they are nothing alike."
16,26,Lipton Yellow Label Tea International Blend 31.74oz,5.0,"Good iced tea is the solution to anyone who pays a lot for unhealthy carbonated beverages and lugs them home from the grocery store.  The directions describe making a cup of hot tea from a teaspoon or tea leaves.  They must like their tea strong!  By my estimate, I'll make 60 gallons of fairly strong iced tea from this one large box of loose tea.  Incidentally, the box is bilingual.  Half is English and the other half is Farsi, Persian or some other Middle Eastern language."
